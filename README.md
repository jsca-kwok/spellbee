This project was created in 10 days using the MERN stack. 
My 1 year old daughter inspired me to create SpellBee. 
I wanted to build something fun and educational for kids, but as a parent, I know how important it is to have control over the content that is exposed to your child. SpellBee gives parents lots of flexibility to add, modify, and delete vocabulary decks with their own choice of words and images.
